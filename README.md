# Refactor_project
My understanding of this project was to refactor a website's code in both HTML and CSS in order to improve on its accessibility and to leave the code in cleaner form.  I used the demo website provided with this homework module and commented inside the HTML and CSS where I made changes. For example, I changed the title on the HTML page from "website" which is generic, to "Horiseon", which is the name of the fictitious company.  I also fixed one of the internal links by adding a div ID to bring the user to the correct spot on the webpage.  I made minor changes in the indentation of some of the HTML. I also added alternate ID's to each of the images in HTML.  

In the stylesheet, I condensed the code by combining selectors with the same property and value.  I also made minor changes to the color palette.  In the original, the company's name included a span of three letters (S,E,O) in a different color to represent the acronym for Search Engine Optimization, the company's mission.  However, the shift in color was very faint and hard to read, so I changed it to yellow, which connects to the "rise" (like the sun over the horizon) in the company's name which is present because of the shift in spelling.  I also changed the shade of blue in the three large boxes below the hero box to match the blue in the header.  Originally, it matched neither the header, the aside, or anything else specifically in the imagery.
